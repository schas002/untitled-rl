# untitled-rl

> Yet another roguelike in FreeBASIC.

## Install

```sh
$ fbc untitled-rl
```

### Dependencies

- [FreeBASIC](http://freebasic.net/), obviously.

## Usage

```sh
$ untitled-rl
```

## Status

It's not a roguelike, *yet*. It's more of a demo. At this point in time, I *already* have a `Person` type which can have an on-screen character of any color and can be moved.

## Controls

In the demo:

| Key(s)                                     | Action |
|:-------------------------------------------|-------:|
| <kbd>q</kbd>, <kbd>Q</kbd>, <kbd>Esc</kbd> | Exit   |

The character can be moved using *any of* WASD, numbers (`8426`), arrows or Vim keys.
